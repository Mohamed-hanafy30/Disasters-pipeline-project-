### Project Motivation:<a name="motivation"></a>

I applied the data pipeline skills learned to analyze disaster data from Figure Eight to build a model for an API that classifies disaster messages. I built a machine learning pipeline to categorize emergency messages based on the needs communicated by the sender.


### Libraries and Installation:<a name="lib"></a>

This project requires Python 3.x and the following Python libraries installed:

* Numpy
* Pandas
* Seaborn
* Scikit-learn
* matplotlib
* NLTK
* sqlalchemy
* re
* pickle

### File Descriptions:<a name="files"></a> 

The Jupyter notebook showcases the analysis done in order to **Extract,Transform and Load.** This steps are coded in **ETL Pipeline Preparation_final.ipynb.**
And the Machine learning procedeures are in **ML Pipeline Preparation_final.ipynb**


### Dataset:<a name="data"></a>

In this project we have **Two** datasets from which are posted by **Figure-eight company**

- **disaster_messages.csv** which contain different messages from different disaster messages sent by people in region of a natural disaster
- **disaster_categories.csv** which clarify categories of these disasters messages
